# simplymechas
A fairly simple RimWorld mechanoid mod. Makes mecha weapons obtainable by trade, allows centipedes to use miniguns.
## A bit of history
The SimplyMechas mod, originally called "Good Old Mechanoids", was my first try on RimWorld modding. I made it in 2019 and was excited it actually worked. However, I lost the original files, and this remake was written from scratch. Now it patches the vanilla defs instead of having its own modified def files, as the "Good Old Mechanoids" used to. It also doesn't patch the lancers (the original mod allowed them to use charge rifles).
